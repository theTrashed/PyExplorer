# PyExplorer

PyExplorer is a file manager built using the PyQt5 library in Python.
Currently, it enables the user to display files/directories in either a list or
grid view, with either sorting enabled or disabled (if enabled, can be in
either ascending or descending order), and with the showing of hidden files
disabled or enabled.  Works on both Linux and Windows. Windows functionality
limited to the *Home drive* only.
